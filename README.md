This is a github app which configures a webhook for listening to `issues` github-event. If the issue has label `good first issue` or `good-first-issue`, the webhook tweets the ticket through [@goodfirstissue](https://twitter.com/goodfirstissue) twitter handle and the followers (potential `first time contributors`) will get real time notification of the issues.

The idea came to my mind as I was going through different repos to look for a `good-first-issue` as I want to start my open source contributions journey.
